# Overview

## Description

This workshop provides a life example on how to build, run and visualize
cytometry data pre-processing pipelines, using the `CytoPipeline` 
suite of packages.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic familiarity with flow cytometry (FC) data and data structures 
(e.g. flowCore::flowFrame)  
- Interest in building automated data pre-processing pipelines 
for cytometry data  
- Some knowledge about typical cytometry data pre-processing steps: 
compensation, scale transformation, 
quality control of signal stability in time, 
removal of un-desirable events, like doublets, debris, dead cells,etc.
A good overview article is (Liechti et al. 2021).


## Participation

The present `.Rmd` file  is designed to support, either an instructor-led live 
demo, or a lab format where participants run the example code on their own.  
Therefore it is up to you to decide how to spend your time during the
workshop, either by listening to the instructor, or by running the code chunks
one by one at your own pace, or a combination of both.

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

- CytoPipeline (available in _Bioconductor°_ since 3.17)
- CytoPipelineGUI (submitted to _Bioconductor_, target version 3.18)
- CytoPipelineUtils (from public github repository)

# Workshop

## Introduction

### Context

Automated analysis of cytometry data can be schematically split into different 
big parts, as is shown in Figure 1. 

```{r highLevelWorkflowDisplay, results='markup', fig.cap="Fig. 1: high level workflow for cytometry data analysis - adapted from (Liechti et al, 2021).", echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/cytoDataWorkflow.png", error = FALSE)
```

The `CytoPipeline` packages suite is aimed at facilitating the design and 
assessment of automated pre-processing pipelines for cytometry data
analysis. This means that we are targeting 
the 'Data pre-processing' box in Figure 1. 

For flow cytometry data, this pre-processing part typically contains the 
following steps:
- *signal compensation*, i.e. a linear transformation of the intensity matrix,
in order to cope with *spillover* of channel light signal to the other channels  
- *scale transformation*, i.e. non linear transformation of fluorescent signal,
in order to better to obtain a better separation between cell populations  
- *QC in time*, i.e. control of signal stability in time  
- filtering of undesirable events like *margins* (outliers), debris, doublets 
and dead cells.  

### The example dataset

The example dataset that will be used throughout this vignette is derived from 
a reference public dataset accompanying the OMIP-021 (Optimized Multicolor 
Immunofluorescence Panel 021) article (Gherardin et al, 2014).  

A sub-sample of this public dataset, with 2 *fcs* files containing measurements 
of 16 markers for 5,000 events each, is built-in in the `CytoPipeline` 
package, as the *OMIP021* dataset. 

See the `MakeOMIP021Samples.R` script for more details 
on how the `OMIP021` dataset was created. This script is to be found 
in the `script` subdirectory in the `CytoPipeline` package installation path.


### Target pipelines 

In this workshop, we will pre-process the two samples of our dataset, using two 
different pipeline set-ups, aiming at comparing two different QC in time 
methods : 
- *flowAI* (Monaco et al, 2016)
- *PeacoQC* (Emmaneel et al, 2021).

In both pipelines, the first part consists in estimating appropriate scale
transformation functions for all channels present in the sample `flowFrame`.
In order to do this, we propose the following *scale transformation processing 
queue* (Fig. 2):   

- reading the three samples `.fcs` files
- removing the margin events from each file
- applying compensation for each file
- aggregating and sub-sampling from each file
- estimating the scale transformations from the aggregated 
and sub-sampled data   

```{r scaleTransformQueueDisplay, results='markup', fig.cap="Fig.2 : Scale transform processing queue", echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/scaleTransformQueue.png", error = FALSE)
```

When this first part is done, one can apply pre-processing for each file 
one by one. However, depending on the choice of QC in time method, 
the order of steps needs to be slightly different:

- when using *flowAI*, it is advised to eliminate the 'bad events' 
starting from raw data - see (Monaco et al, 2016).
- when using *PeacoQC*, it is advised to eliminate the 'bad events' 
from already compensated and scale transformed data - 
see (Emmaneel et al, 2021).

Therefore, we propose the following *pre-processing queues* represented in 
Fig. 3.

```{r preProcessingQueueDisplay, results='markup', fig.cap="Fig. 3 : Pre-processing queue for two different pipeline settings", echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/preProcessingQueues.png", error = FALSE)
```

### Essential CytoPipeline concepts

The *CytoPipeline* framework is based on two main concepts, 
namely *CytoPipeline* and *CytoProcessingSteps*. 
A *CytoPipeline* object centralizes the pipeline definition, 
and specifies the run order of the different pipeline steps. 
On top of the steps definition, it also has an *experimentName* 
as a key for storing the results, and a vector of sample files on which to run 
the pipeline.

These *CytoPipeline* steps materialize as *CytoProcessingStep* objects, 
which store pipeline step names and the corresponding R functions 
that will be called at execution time. 
These functions are either provided within the *CytoPipeline* package itself, 
exported from third party packages, or coded by the user themself. 
Together with the function name to be called, a *CytoProcessingStep* object 
also contains the list of parameters that are used as arguments to the function.


## Creating a CytoPipeline object

```{r preliminaries, include = FALSE}
# preliminaries : define sample files and and set path to results output 

rawDataDir <- system.file("extdata", package = "CytoPipeline")

resultsDir <- 
    "./Results"
# clean up previous rmd runs if necessary
unlink(resultsDir, recursive = TRUE)
dir.create(resultsDir)

mySamples <- file.path(rawDataDir, list.files(rawDataDir,
                                              pattern = "Donor"))

```

There are essentially two ways to create a *CytoPipeline* object, 
either by defining the *CytoProcessingStep* one by one using R code,
or by providing a json file as in input.

### Step by step creation in R code

Here we show an extract on how to build the pipeline step by step in R code,
showing only the code to include the first two steps for building 
the scale transformation. 

When done, we print the content of the *CytoPipeline* object.

```{r step0, comment = ''}

expName <- "CytoPipeline_Demo"

pipL0 <- CytoPipeline(experimentName = expName,
                      sampleFiles = mySamples)

### SCALE TRANSFORMATION STEPS ###

pipL0 <- addProcessingStep(pipL0,
                           whichQueue = "scale transform",
                           CytoProcessingStep(
                                name = "flowframe_read",
                                FUN = "readSampleFiles",
                                ARGS = list(
                                    whichSamples = "all",
                                    truncate_max_range = FALSE,
                                    min.limit = NULL
                                )))

pipL0 <- addProcessingStep(pipL0,
                           whichQueue = "scale transform",
                           CytoProcessingStep(
                               name = "remove_margins",
                               FUN = "removeMarginsPeacoQC",
                               ARGS = list()))
        
pipL0   

```

### Centralizing the pipeline definition in a json file

However, the easiest, and most concise way to define a *CytoPipeline* object 
is by using a json file. Here we will use the following input file, 
which specifies the *flowAI* pipeline as described above.

```{r jsonFileShow, comment = ''}
jsonFile <- ("CytoPipeline_Demo_fAI.json")
cat(readLines(jsonFile), sep = '\n')
```

We now create our *CytoPipeline* object using this json file as input, and 
print the content of the object again. 

```{r step1, comment = ''}


# 1.


# creation of CytoPipeline object,
# using json file as input
pipL <- CytoPipeline(jsonFile, 
                     experimentName = expName,
                     sampleFiles = mySamples)

# display CytoPipeline object
pipL

```

As soon as the *CytoPipeline* object is created, it is possible to 
visualize the pipeline as a workflow plot, using the
`CytoPipeline::plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue()` function.  


```{r step2_plot, out.height=450, out.width=600, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(pipL, 
                                whichQueue = "pre-processing",
                                path = resultsDir,
                                sampleFile = 1)
```

In this plot, each arrow represents a step (as defined by the user), and
the results of each step is represented as a bubble. Here, all bubbles are 
colored in orange, meaning that there is no results yet available for these 
steps, since the pipeline has not been executed yet.


## Executing and visualizing the pipeline run 

### Base pipeline

When the *CytoPipeline* object has been created with all needed steps, we 
can run it, by calling the `CytoPipeline::execute()` function.  

```{r step2:with_errors}

# 2.

# execute pipeline
try(execute(pipL, path = resultsDir))
```

Here, this leads to an error message in the `remove_debris` step, complaining that the `nClust` 
argument is missing. This error is due to the fact that we intentionally left a typo 
in our input json file, replacing the `nclust` parameter 
with a `nClusters` parameter :-O !  

Now it is interesting to take a look at the workflow plot: 

```{r step2_with_errors_plot, out.height=450, out.width=600, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(pipL, 
                                whichQueue = "pre-processing",
                                path = resultsDir,
                                sampleFile = 1)

```

Note that the first five bubbles are now highlighted in green, showing that
the first five steps have now produced results. These results have in fact
been saved in a data cache, allowing for further visualization of the results.  

However, as mentioned earlier, the sixth step, 'remove_debris', 
has resulted in an error, hence there is still not corresponding results, 
and so the corresponding bubble is still displayed with an orange contour.  

Let's now correct our typo in the json file, and re-run our pipeline, under 
the same experiment name : 

```{r step2_ok, out.height=450, out.width=600, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}

jsonFile <- ("CytoPipeline_Demo_fAI_2.json")

# creation of CytoPipeline object,
# using json file as input
pipL <- CytoPipeline(jsonFile, 
                     experimentName = expName,
                     sampleFiles = mySamples)

# execute pipeline
try(execute(pipL, path = resultsDir))

plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(pipL, 
                                whichQueue = "pre-processing",
                                path = resultsDir,
                                sampleFile = 1)

```


The pipeline now executes correctly! Note that all steps that were previously 
correctly executed are not re-run, the results are instead read from the data 
cache.

<br/>

Let us now visualize our results, using one of the two shiny applications 
implemented in the *CytoPipelineGUI* package.

```{r, step2_viz}

# launch shiny app
CytoPipelineGUI::CytoPipelineCheckApp(dir = resultsDir)

```

When visualizing interactively the results of our pipeline, more specifically 
when looking at the `remove_debris` step in the FSC-A/SSC-A 2D representation, 
we can notice that, for the second sample, this step eliminated much more 
than the undesirable debris events. This has to be improved! 

<br/>

```{r step2_viz_prog, out.height=300, out.width=900, fig.height=6, fig.width=18, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

if (!interactive()) {
    p1 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
    experimentName = expName,
    whichQueue = "pre-processing",
    sampleFile = 2,
    flowFrameName = "remove_doublets_obj",
    path = resultsDir,
    xChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
    yChannelLabel = "SSC-A : NA",
    useAllCells = TRUE,
    useFixedLinearRange = TRUE,
    linearRange = c(-111, 262144))
    
p2 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
    experimentName = expName,
    whichQueue = "pre-processing",
    sampleFile = 2,
    flowFrameName = "remove_debris_obj",
    path = resultsDir,
    xChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
    yChannelLabel = "SSC-A : NA",
    useAllCells = TRUE,
    useFixedLinearRange = TRUE,
    linearRange = c(-111, 262144))
    
p3 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotDiffFlowFrame(
    path = resultsDir,
    experimentNameFrom = expName,
    whichQueueFrom = "pre-processing",
    sampleFileFrom = 2,
    flowFrameNameFrom = "remove_doublets_obj",
    xChannelLabelFrom = "FSC-A : NA",
    yChannelLabelFrom = "SSC-A : NA",
    experimentNameTo = expName,
    whichQueueTo = "pre-processing",
    sampleFileTo = 2,
    flowFrameNameTo = "remove_debris_obj",
    xChannelLabelTo = "FSC-A : NA",
    yChannelLabelTo = "SSC-A : NA",
    useAllCells = TRUE,
    useFixedLinearRange = TRUE,
    linearRange = c(-111, 262144))

 print(p1+p2+p3)

}

```

### Running the same pipeline with different function parameters

In order to cope with the issue of the `remove_debris`step, we create a new
pipeline with the same steps, only we use `nClust = 3` instead of `nClust = 2` 
as the number of clusters to be found during this step. We run this amended 
version of the pipeline under a new experiment name, in order to allow for
visual comparison of results between the two versions.

```{r step3_nClust_3, out.height=450, out.width=600, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}

# 3.

# create pipeline with nClust = 3

expName <- "CytoPipeline_Demo_3C"

jsonFile <- ("CytoPipeline_Demo_fAI_3C.json")

pipL2 <- CytoPipeline(jsonFile,
                      experimentName = expName,
                      sampleFiles = mySamples)


# execute pipeline
execute(pipL2, path = resultsDir)

plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(pipL2, 
                                whichQueue = "pre-processing",
                                path = resultsDir,
                                sampleFile = 2)
```

Now that this pipeline has run until completion, we can now visualize 
interactively what the `remove_debris` gives as results, 
with this new `nClust = 3` parameter. We can notice that the debris removal,
for sample 2, has worked much better with this new parameter setting.

``` {r, step3::resultsViz}

# launch shiny app
CytoPipelineGUI::CytoPipelineCheckApp(dir = resultsDir)

```


```{r, step3_viz_prog, out.height=300, out.width=900, fig.height=6, fig.width=18, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
if (!interactive()) {
    p1 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
        experimentName = expName,
        whichQueue = "pre-processing",
        sampleFile = 2,
        flowFrameName = "remove_doublets_obj",
        path = resultsDir,
        xChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
        yChannelLabel = "SSC-A : NA",
        useAllCells = TRUE,
        useFixedLinearRange = TRUE,
        linearRange = c(-111, 262144))
    
    p2 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
        experimentName = expName,
        whichQueue = "pre-processing",
        sampleFile = 2,
        flowFrameName = "remove_debris_obj",
        path = resultsDir,
        xChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
        yChannelLabel = "SSC-A : NA",
        useAllCells = TRUE,
        useFixedLinearRange = TRUE,
        linearRange = c(-111, 262144))
    
    p3 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotDiffFlowFrame(
        path = resultsDir,
        experimentNameFrom = expName,
        whichQueueFrom = "pre-processing",
        sampleFileFrom = 2,
        flowFrameNameFrom = "remove_doublets_obj",
        xChannelLabelFrom = "FSC-A : NA",
        yChannelLabelFrom = "SSC-A : NA",
        experimentNameTo = expName,
        whichQueueTo = "pre-processing",
        sampleFileTo = 2,
        flowFrameNameTo = "remove_debris_obj",
        xChannelLabelTo = "FSC-A : NA",
        yChannelLabelTo = "SSC-A : NA",
        useAllCells = TRUE,
        useFixedLinearRange = TRUE,
        linearRange = c(-111, 262144))
    
    print(p1+p2+p3)
}
```

### Comparing pipelines

In this section, we will run the alternative pipeline using *PeacoQC* as 
QC in time method, and then compare with what we get with *flowAI*. 
As mentioned in the introduction, the *PeacoQC* pipeline implies a slightly 
order of the steps as well. The pipeline is described in the following 
json file:

```{r jsonFileFlowAIShow, comment = ''}
jsonFile <- ("CytoPipeline_Demo_PQC.json")
cat(readLines(jsonFile), sep = '\n')
```

Let us now create a new CytoPipeline object, and execute it.

```{r step4, out.height=450, out.width=600, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
# 4.
# creation of a new CytoPipeline object,
# using json file as input (flowAI)
pipL_PQC <- CytoPipeline(jsonFile,
                         experimentName = "CytoPipeline_Demo_PQC",
                         sampleFiles = mySamples)

# display CytoPipeline object
pipL_PQC

# execute pipeline
execute(pipL_PQC, path = resultsDir)

plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(pipL_PQC, 
                                whichQueue = "pre-processing",
                                path = resultsDir,
                                sampleFile = 1)

```

The pipeline having run until completion, time to visualize the results!

``` {r, step4::resultsViz}
CytoPipelineGUI::CytoPipelineCheckApp(dir = resultsDir)
```

```{r, step4_viz_prog, out.height=300, out.width=900, fig.height=6, fig.width=18, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
expName1 <- "CytoPipeline_Demo_3C"
expName2 <- "CytoPipeline_Demo_PQC"
if (!interactive()) {
    p1 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
        experimentName = expName1,
        whichQueue = "pre-processing",
        sampleFile = 2,
        flowFrameName = "perform_QC_obj",
        path = resultsDir,
        xChannelLabel = "Time : NA",
        yChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
        useAllCells = TRUE,
        useFixedLinearRange = FALSE)
    
    p2 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
        experimentName = expName2,
        whichQueue = "pre-processing",
        sampleFile = 2, 
        flowFrameName = "perform_QC_obj",
        path = resultsDir,
        xChannelLabel = "Time : NA",
        yChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
        useAllCells = TRUE,
        useFixedLinearRange = FALSE)
    
    p3 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotDiffFlowFrame(
        path = resultsDir,
        experimentNameFrom = expName1,
        whichQueueFrom = "pre-processing",
        sampleFileFrom = 2, 
        flowFrameNameFrom = "perform_QC_obj",
        xChannelLabelFrom = "Time : NA",
        yChannelLabelFrom = "FSC-A : NA",
        experimentNameTo = expName2,
        whichQueueTo = "pre-processing",
        sampleFileTo = 2,
        flowFrameNameTo = "perform_QC_obj",
        xChannelLabelTo = "Time : NA",
        yChannelLabelTo = "FSC-A : NA",
        useAllCells = TRUE,
        useFixedLinearRange = FALSE)
    
    print(p1+p2+p3)
}
```

## Visualization of scale transformations

Besides the flowFrame comparison tool, *CytoPipelineGUI* provides another 
shiny app, which allows to interactively visualize and manage 
the scale transformations that are generated as part of our prep-processing 
pipelines.  

If the shape of the scale transformations that were automatically set by the
chosen algorithm appears to be non satisfactory, it is possible, using this
shiny application, to manually adjust the parameters of the transformation,
and save the results in a RDS object. This object can then be re-used in another
pipeline instance.

```{r, step5}
# 5. show scale transformations
CytoPipelineGUI::ScaleTransformApp(dir = resultsDir)
```

## Some technical options to fine-tune pipeline execution

To end up with this workshop, let us experiment with some technical options
that are available to fine-tune the pipeline execution.

### Cleaning the results cache before running

We have mentioned earlier that the results produced at each step are stored
in a cache, allowing for further visual assessment. This cache is built thanks 
to the Bioconductor package `BiocFileCache`.

As a matter of fact, this caching mechanism also allows to re-use previously 
obtained results in case of a re-run, because by default, the cache will not 
be erased before running again the pipeline. 

However, it could be useful in some cases to erase the cache 
prior to running. This can for example happen when re-running the pipeline 
with the same experiment id, but with an amended pipeline definition.

For this, the `rmCache` parameter of the `execute()` function can be set to 
`TRUE`.

```{r, step6a}
# 6a. execute pipeline with rmCache = TRUE

execute(pipL_PQC, path = resultsDir, rmCache = TRUE)
```

### Running sample files in parallel

Another very useful feature, especially when dealing with a large number 
of samples, is the ability to run the pipeline in parallel for the different
samples. To implement this feature, *CytoPipeline* makes use 
of the Bioconductor *BiocParallel* package, so that the most appropriate 
backend (MulticoreParams, SnowParam,... ) can be used.

```{r, step6b}
# 6b. execute pipeline in parallel
bp <- BiocParallel::SnowParam(progressbar = TRUE)

execute(pipL_PQC, path = resultsDir, rmCache = TRUE, useBiocParallel = TRUE,
        BPPARAM = bp,
        BPOPTIONS = BiocParallel::bpoptions(package = c("flowCore", 
                                                        "CytoPipelineUtils")))
```
